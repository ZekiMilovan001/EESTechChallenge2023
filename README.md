## Vaskrs
Vaskrs is a game we made during a 24 - hour period at the EESTech hackathon, with a theme **"Choose One"**.\
We worked in a team of three and we got a chance to develop our gamedev skills and our teamwork.

The game is a story-based adventure that revolves around saving Jesus Christ. \
Throughout the game, you are presented with various choices, some of which are moral and others that are not. If we choose the non-moral path, it often comes at a cost in the long run, and if we decide to stay at the moral path, sometimes more difficult path, we get awarded at the end.

#How to
You can fork this repository and pull it, then open the project with Unity and run it.
You move the character with **WSAD**, use special ability of Jesus with **R** and **mouse** to choose your path to success.
