# Vaskrs
Vaskrs is a game we made during 24h period on EESTech hackathon with a theme **"Choose One"**.\
We worked in a team of three and we got a chance to develop our gamedev skills and our teamwork.

It is a story time game about saving Jesus Christ. Trough out the game we have multiple choices of witch some are moral and some are not. If we choose the non moral path, usually the easier path it will cost us in the long run.
